 				<div id="chicken">Chicken</div>
 				<p> Boneless, skinless chicken breasts (aka BSCBs) — is there anything more boring? They are all too often overcooked until dry and chewy, and I generally prefer more succulent boneless, skinless thighs. But for lunch and dinner favorites like chicken Caesar salad and chicken pasta, sliced juicy chicken breasts can't be beat. They're a great staple for quick lunches, too. Fortunately I have one method that makes unfailingly juicy and tender boneless, skinless chicken breasts. </p>

				<div id="beef">Beef</div>
				<p> I still think the roast beef of old England, served with meaty gravy, crisp Yorkshire pudding and crunchy roast potatoes, is not only one of the world's greatest meals, it is something the British do better than anyone else. The cut of beef for roasting is of great importance – if it's a very special occasion I would go for a sirloin joint on the bone with the fillet still in it, but for a family Sunday lunch the next best cut is the wing end of the sirloin. </p>
